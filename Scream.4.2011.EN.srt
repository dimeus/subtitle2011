1
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:17,266
- Hello?
- Hello.

2
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,643
- Uh, yes?
- Who is this?

3
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:22,688
- Who are you calling?
- Who am I speaking to?

4
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,106
Wrong number.

5
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,442
- Who was that?
- Nobody.

6
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:28,736
- Did you pick a movie?
- Yeah.

7
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:30,988
We're gonna go scary. Saw IV.

8
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:34,783
I saw that in theaters.
It sucks. It's not scary, it's gross.

9
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:38,579
- I hate all that torture porn shit.
- How do you really feel?

10
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:43,792
Well, I like Jigsaw.
I think he kills people very creatively.

11
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,920
But you don't give a shit who dies,
'cause there's no character development.

12
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:49,798
There's just body parts ripping
and blood spewing. Blahh!

13
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:51,550
Who do you keep texting?

14
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,470
I have a Facebook stalker.
He keeps leaving me messages.

15
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:57,097
- Yeah, like what?
- Just stuff.

16
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:59,808
Like, "Hey, what's up?
You're hot. I wanna kill you. "

17
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:01,602
So delete him.

18
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,146
I did, but he hacked his way back in.

19
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:06,482
So report him.

20
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:10,986
He's really hot, though.
You wanna see?

21
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:16,325
That's Channing Tatum.

22
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,702
It is not. Is it?

23
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,831
Yeah, from his Abercrombie days.
You are being punked.

24
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,715
- Hello?
- Who is this?

25
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:34,593
The more impatient version
of the person you just spoke to.

26
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,554
I'm sorry. You don't
have to be a bitch about it.

27
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:39,890
- Of course I don't. Eat me.
- You hang up on me,

28
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:42,184
and I'll cut through your neck
until I feel bone!

29
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,229
- Who is it?
- It's for you.

30
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,275
- Hello?
- Who is this?

31
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,236
It's Trudie. Who's this?

32
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:55,781
This is the last person
you're ever gonna see alive.

33
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,157
It's a prank. Hang up.

34
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:02,162
- Why'd you hand the phone to me?
- You're the one with the stalker.

35
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,124
- Are the doors locked?
- Don't freak out.

36
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:10,963
Let it ring.

37
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,474
It's from stalker boy.
He said, "Answer the phone. "

38
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:26,895
For God's sake. It's a joke,
Trudie. It's probably Lexi or Karen.

39
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:30,232
- Where are you going?
- To make sure the front door is locked.

40
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:36,071
- No. Don't open it.
- You're overreacting.

41
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:42,035
It's a joke, Trudie, OK?
Somebody made a dummy profile.

42
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:45,873
- They're just trying to scare you.
- Wait. Who is it?

43
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,334
I said, who is it?

44
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,546
Let's call the cops.

45
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:59,261
"I dare you to open the door. "
No, Sherrie. Don't.

46
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,054
No, don't, I'm scared.

47
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:03,515
Hey, it could be anyone that we know.

48
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:08,395
Lisa, Bailey, Wayne, or the
hopeful long shot, Channing Tatum.

49
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,456
There's nobody out here.

50
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,337
What does it say?

51
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,966
It says, "I'm not outside.
I'm right beside you. "

52
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:43,972
Trudie! Trudie! Oh, my God!

53
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:04,868
- You're fucking kidding me.
- What?

54
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,287
That was so fucking stupid.
Pure horseshit.

55
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,831
The death of horror,
right here in front of us.

56
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:13,001
- I jumped. It scared me.
- A fucking Facebook killer?

57
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,337
You're kidding me, right?

58
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:18,507
I guess now it would be Twitter.
That'd make more sense.

59
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:22,344
A bunch of articulate teens sit around
and deconstruct horror movies

60
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:26,640
until Ghostface kills them one by one.
It's been done to death.

61
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,851
The whole self-aware,
postmodern meta shit.

62
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:33,313
Stick a fork in 1996, already.

63
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:36,566
I like the Stab movies. They're scarier.

64
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:39,861
It's not aliens or zombies
or little Asian ghost girls.

65
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:43,198
There's something real about
a guy with a knife who just...

66
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,702
...snaps.

67
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,579
It could really happen.

68
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,375
I can't do it. These sequels
don't know when to stop.

69
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:57,170
They just keep recycling the same shit.
Even the opening scene.

70
00:04:57,338 --> 00:05:00,132
There's always some random girl who
gets a call that undoubtedly ends up

71
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,510
getting her killed. It's so predictable,
there's no element of surprise.

72
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,804
You can see evertyhing coming.

73
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:14,563
Did that surprise you?

74
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,861
- Why?
- Because you talk too much.

75
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,991
Now, shut the fuck up
and watch the movie.

76
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,754
Oh, my God, I love it. I've seen it five
times and it still gets me every time.

77
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,840
You're kidding. I don't get it.

78
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:47,179
OK... It's like The Twilight Zone.

79
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,097
- Twilight Zone?
- A movie within a movie.

80
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:51,058
I get that. But it's illogical.

81
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:53,769
It begs the question that if the
beginning of Stab 7 is Stab 6,

82
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:58,148
then is the beginning of Stab 6 Stab 5?
And, if so, what is Stab 4 about?

83
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,025
- You're over-thinking it.
- Am I?

84
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,027
Or did whoever make it
just under-think it?

85
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,904
There's a reason
I don't watch these movies.

86
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:07,449
I can't believe you haven't seen them.
We live in Woodsboro.

87
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,035
That has nothing to do with Woodsboro.

88
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,788
I thought you said Stab
was based on true stories.

89
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:16,541
The first three, the original trilogy,
is based off of Sidney Prescott,

90
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,960
but then she threatened to sue them
if they used her story,

91
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:20,921
so then they just started
making stuff up.

92
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:24,299
Stab 5 has time travel,
which is by far the worst.

93
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:27,052
Don't we hear enough
about this story every year?

94
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,222
At least Woodsboro's
known for something.

95
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,309
- Did you hear that?
- Um...

96
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:39,106
- No, I didn't hear anything.
- I did.

97
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,026
Jenny, don't try to scare me.

98
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,153
- I'm not trying to scare you.
- You do it all the time.

99
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:47,656
- No, I don't.
- Where are you going?

100
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:51,243
- I told you, I heard something.
- I know you're trying to scare me.

101
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,662
I'm not.

102
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,336
What is it?

103
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,382
I must have left
a window in my room open.

104
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,846
Could you get that?

105
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:13,056
- Marnie?
- Yeah.

106
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:21,148
- Hello?
- Hello. Who is this?

107
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,191
Marnie. Who is this?

108
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:28,113
This is the last person
you're ever gonna see alive.

109
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,991
What?

110
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:36,830
I'm sorry. I had to.

111
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:40,625
You bitch. So not funny.

112
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,044
Somebody falls for it every year.

113
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:44,838
I don't see why you get off on this...

114
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,258
Marnie?

115
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,137
Marnie?

116
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:56,933
Marnie?

117
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,985
Good one, Marnie.
Lights out, phone on the floor.

118
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:11,948
You know, you really
should direct horror films.

119
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,950
Wherever you are.

120
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,414
Let me guess. You want me
to walk by an open doorframe

121
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,958
so you can pop out, huh?

122
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,925
OK. Timing, timing is perfect.

123
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:32,219
But you don't have the app on your phone

124
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:35,555
so you can't talk like Ghostface,
can you?

125
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,807
Yes, I can.

126
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:41,311
- Who is this?
- Not an app.

127
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,689
- Is this Trevor?
- Do I sound like a Trevor to you?

128
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,567
Think of me as your director.
You're in my movie.

129
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,694
You got a fun part, so don't blow it.

130
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,613
- What movie?
- Same one Marnie's in.

131
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,115
Only her part got cut way back.

132
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:57,244
But you, you're the dumb blonde
with the big tits.

133
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,996
We'll have some fun with you
before you die.

134
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:04,042
I have a 4.0 GPA and a 135 IQ, asshole.

135
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,502
What did you do with Marnie?

136
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,213
- She's on the cutting room floor.
- That's not funny.

137
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,841
This isn't a comedy. It's a horror film.
People live, people die.

138
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,927
And you'd better start running.

139
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:19,933
Marnie?

140
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,573
What do you think?

141
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:43,159
Well, I guess today is the anniversary.

142
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,787
- Kids.
- No, I meant the display.

143
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,288
Oh.

144
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,629
- It's good.
- I told the owner I'd kill his cat

145
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:58,883
- if he didn't get it right.
- Nice.

146
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,608
Mmm.

147
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:41,342
Ho! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

148
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:45,972
- Twenty-five, stay alive!
- Shit! Sorry, Sheriff!

149
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,100
Kirby.

150
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,646
Hoo!

151
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:08,578
Hey, before you get in the car,
you have to promise not to kill me.

152
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,705
Why? What did you do?

153
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,500
- Trevor called me last night.
- Why is he calling you?

154
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,543
Because you won't take his calls.

155
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:18,213
He knows I have your ear,
and he wants to know.

156
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,673
- Know what?
- How upset you are.

157
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,551
Look, can we just not
talk about this now, please?

158
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,220
Fine. Fine.

159
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:29,057
- OK, so Trevor called me last night.
- He called you, too?

160
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,850
He's worried your cousin
coming to Woodsboro

161
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,520
is distracting you from knowing
how sorry he really is.

162
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:36,314
- Well, that's inventive.
- Oh, God.

163
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:44,239
By the way, have you seen
the Grim Reaper? Angel of Death?

164
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:47,200
- What are you talking about?
- Your cousin.

165
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,160
Last stop on her book tour,

166
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:53,748
first stop on her road to a new life.
It's very dramatic.

167
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,875
She's the reason
why I love horror movies.

168
00:13:56,043 --> 00:14:00,421
I'm sure she'd love to hear that.
If I knew her, which I don't, really.

169
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,258
Wherever she went, people died.

170
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,552
Other people. It was never her.

171
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:08,847
I mean, Stab is the wrong franchise
for her. It should be Final Destination.

172
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:12,600
- OK, why is Jenny Randall calling me?
- I can't stand Jenny.

173
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,644
- Hello?
- Hello, Jill.

174
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:18,606
- Why...
- Shh. Jenny? Is this you?

175
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:21,401
What's your favorite scary movie?

176
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:24,237
- OK, who is this?
- What does she want?

177
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:29,325
- I said, who is this?
- I asked you a question.

178
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:34,414
- What's your favorite scary movie?
- I'm hanging up.

179
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:38,877
Wow. That was original.

180
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:42,046
I got a call like that this morning
from Marnie the Carny.

181
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,299
- What?
- Watch out!

182
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,012
Nice move, asshole!

183
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:53,766
- You just ran a stop sign.
- Sorry.

184
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,896
The Angel of Death.

185
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,528
The mayor wants these down before lunch.

186
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:06,946
Only 25 more to go.

187
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,786
- Morning, Sheriff.
- Morning, Deputy.

188
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,955
- Joe.
- Morning, Sheriff.

189
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:20,376
- Looks like the celebration's begun.
- High school kids, probably.

190
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:24,505
Yeah. One generation's tragedy
is the next one's joke.

191
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:28,009
Sorry you can never get away from this.

192
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,845
You know, I wish I'd been old enough
to be a part of the force

193
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,932
when you were solving those crimes.

194
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:37,769
It's those intense investigations
that really bond relationships.

195
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:42,607
- Well, yeah.
- How is Gale, by the way?

196
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:47,654
Gale's good, she's writing. Fiction.

197
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:51,950
Hey, I made some lemon squares.
They're in my car.

198
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,036
Thanks, Deputy, but no thanks.

199
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:59,123
Sheriff, you're not cheating on
your wife if you eat my lemon square.

200
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,627
Yeah, but I would be
cheating on my diet.

201
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,546
Sheriff Riley?
Come in, Sheriff Riley!

202
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,298
This is Sheriff Riley. Go ahead.

203
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,175
You gotta get over to the
Randall house right away.

204
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,719
It's bad, Sheriff, real bad.

205
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,358
The book is
Out of Darkness

206
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:28,069
and its author, Sidney Prescott,
is here with us today.

207
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:32,865
Have the seven Stab movies, all based
on Gale Weathers' books about you,

208
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,742
made it even harder to go on?

209
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,745
I don't blame Gale. That's in the past.

210
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:42,583
If I was a victim for too long,
it was up to me to reinvent myself.

211
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,420
- That's why I wrote this book.
- Sidney Prescott, everybody.

212
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:49,048
And rave reviews for her book,
Out of Darkness.

213
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:53,678
All right, Gale, let's do it.
Let's reinvent myself.

214
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:57,015
Except...

215
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:02,645
"I have no fucking idea

216
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:05,523
what to write. "

217
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,695
Hey, wait up!

218
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,453
- Is that new?
- That's the 2.0 upgraded version.

219
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,789
- I'm totally mobile now.
- Nice. Look.

220
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:25,126
Oh! This is Hall Pass
with Robbie Mercer,

221
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:28,129
here with the luscious Olivia "Don't
look at my tits, I have a mind" Morris.

222
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:31,299
Here is my Woodsboro Massacre
anniversary question:

223
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,427
- What is your favorite scary movie?
- Is that all you've got?

224
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:37,764
- Some stupid douche question?
- Yeah, where'd you hear that anyways?

225
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:40,558
It's a line from Stab 1, duh.
Hey, Charlie.

226
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,853
You're a genre nut, Kirby.
What's your favorite scary movie?

227
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:44,937
Bambi.

228
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,147
Mm-hm.

229
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,482
- Dork.
- What?

230
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,609
That's funny, Kirby.

231
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:55,239
- Completely unaware you exist.
- No, man, she wants me.

232
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,161
Yeah, I wish, right? Asshole?

233
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:04,499
- I think Charlie likes you.
- And I like him.

234
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,668
To tease, to torment,
to make him squirm.

235
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:10,213
You could do a lot worse, trust me.

236
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:15,968
Oh, hi, Trevor. Bye, Trevor.

237
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,929
Can we talk?

238
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:22,058
Somebody cares about you
over here, you know?

239
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,644
Someone who made you
really happy once.

240
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,063
Someone who never
should have let you go.

241
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,858
When you're done with a phone call,
you let someone go.

242
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:33,861
Or when you take someone to the airport,
you let them go.

243
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:37,573
When you tell someone you love her,
and she gives you evertyhing,

244
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:40,076
and then you just go out with someone
else, that is not letting her go.

245
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:43,788
That's dumping her. OK?
That's... That's betrayal.

246
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:49,043
Trevor Sheldon, denied,
live on Hall Pass with Robbie Mercer.

247
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,045
What is your favorite scary movie, man?

248
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,589
I'll show you.

249
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:04,892
And I began to believe, myself,
that that was all I was, a victim,

250
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,728
and that was unacceptable to me.

251
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:11,315
So I sat down,

252
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:15,069
and began to write a new role
that would be my own.

253
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:18,114
A role for a woman who could
leave the walls of fear behind,

254
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:22,034
and step back into the sunlight,
out of darkness.

255
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:25,413
Thank you.

256
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,874
OK, we're gonna start
the book signing in a sec,

257
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,209
so buy your copies while they last.

258
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:33,588
I'm looking at you, ladies.
New York Times Best Seller.

259
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,923
Rave reviews.

260
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:39,677
- Gale. I'm glad you came.
- Congratulations, Sidney.

261
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,263
I haven't had a chance
to read it yet, but...

262
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,182
I know where you can get one.

263
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:50,188
Dewey! Hey!

264
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,773
Hey, Sid. Gale, you made it.

265
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,150
What's going on, Dewey?

266
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:57,195
Sid, I'm sorry,
I gotta do something here.

267
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,781
I'm really sorry. Excuse me!
This will only take a minute.

268
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:04,118
I need you all to stay where you are
and remain silent.

269
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,995
Nobody leaves yet.
The sheriff thanks you.

270
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,414
Can this wait, Barney Fife?
I'm running an event here.

271
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,291
Ma'am, this is a police event now.

272
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,877
- What's going on?
- Gale, this is police business.

273
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,086
If you could just let us handle this...

274
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:16,631
I'm talking to my husband, Deputy Judy.

275
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,799
Listen, there's a phone we believe

276
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,927
may have been taken
from the scene of a crime.

277
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:24,388
Deputy Hicks has traced its location
back to these coordinates.

278
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:28,684
- The rest is need-to-know.
- I'm not need-to-know?

279
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,899
Sheriff,
it's ringing out here!

280
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,196
There!

281
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,995
It's coming from the trunk! There!

282
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:50,373
- Dewey?
- Gonna need everyone to stay back!

283
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,750
- Not now, Sid.
- It's my rental.

284
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,219
Damn!

285
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,680
OK, it's now an official crime scene.
Let's lock it down.

286
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:08,015
Get that camera out of here!
Everybody back.

287
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:11,269
- Give me that camera!
- Please tell me this is a prank, Dewey.

288
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,771
- I'm afraid not, Sid.
- Back up on the curb, ma'am.

289
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,564
- Come on.
- Everybody get back!

290
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,442
Henry, you're not gonna
believe what just happened.

291
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,696
- Stand back, Gale. Gale!
- I just wanna see.

292
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:23,364
Cover up your kids' eyes!

293
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,243
OK, essays are due Tuesday.

294
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,870
"Why Woodsboro is the best... "

295
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:34,250
Anything with an on-off switch
should be off, that's the rule!

296
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:36,544
Somebody wanna share?

297
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,213
Jenny Randall and Marnie Cooper
were murdered last night.

298
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,382
- What?
- What?

299
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,842
Stabbed to death.

300
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,720
- What's your favorite scary movie?
- Shut up!

301
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:48,222
- Yo, it's a news van.
- Class is not over!

302
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,682
That was fast.

303
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:53,561
This week marks the anniversary
of the infamous Woodsboro Murders.

304
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:58,482
Two girls killed the exact day local
celebrity victim, Sidney Prescott,

305
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,444
- chose to return to her hometown.
- It all could be something right out

306
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:04,905
of a Gale Weathers bestseller.
And where is she now?

307
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:07,575
- Well, living right here in Woodsboro.
- Mrs. Riley.

308
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,077
- Hoss.
- First Lady.

309
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:11,746
Perkins.

310
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,081
Excuse me, Gale.
He's conducting an interview.

311
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,625
- Great. I love interviews.
- You'll have to wait, Gale.

312
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:19,420
Sorry. I can't let you in there.

313
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:22,048
What are you gonna do,
arrest me, Deputy Judy?

314
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:25,343
If it comes to it. Civilian interference
with a police investigation

315
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,261
poses many a problem in a court of law.

316
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:31,265
OK, listen to me, Judy. I don't mind
that you're working with my husband,

317
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:34,518
or that you even bake him
those little treats as you do.

318
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,605
But if you're gonna start acting like
him, you gotta put a moustache on,

319
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,607
- because you sound ridiculous.
- Gale!

320
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,150
- Judy!
- Gale!

321
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,612
Deputy. Gale.

322
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:49,075
Come on, please. Sidney, if you
don't mind giving us a minute...

323
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:51,202
- Sid.
- Hi, Gale.

324
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,747
Dewey, would you please
explain to Betty Crocker

325
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:57,166
that I have every right to be here?

326
00:22:57,334 --> 00:23:00,419
If there's been another murder
in Woodsboro, obviously... What?

327
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:05,424
- That is not public information!
- It is all over the Internet, Dewey!

328
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:06,675
- It is?
- Yes!

329
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:09,303
The whole world
knows about it before me!

330
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:12,264
She wants to be a part
of the investigation, Sheriff.

331
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:14,809
OK. Hang on. Um...

332
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:20,231
Are you familiar with the phrase
"I wrote the book on this"?

333
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:25,319
Gale, with all due respect,

334
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:29,407
- I don't see how that pertains to...
- Because I wrote the book on this!

335
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:33,202
The Woodsboro Murders
by Gale Weathers?

336
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,454
But you're not a reporter anymore, Gale.

337
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,039
- And even if you were...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

338
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:40,835
Don't treat me like I'm the media.
I helped solve these things,

339
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:45,506
three times, remember?
You and me. Together.

340
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:50,511
- But I'm the sheriff now, Gale.
- Right?

341
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,140
What? You're not gonna
let me help you with this?

342
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:56,225
I can't.

343
00:23:58,186 --> 00:23:59,645
All right, then I'm going rogue.

344
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:04,942
This is what I'm good at, Dewey.
This is what I know how to do.

345
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:13,117
Your lemon squares taste like ass.

346
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:17,705
They don't. They really don't.

347
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,039
Thank you, sir.

348
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:20,624
- Sheriff.
- Yeah?

349
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,835
We've got a couple
high school kids in here.

350
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,671
Two of them, they say they got
threatening phone calls this morning

351
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:31,343
from the victims' phones. Names
are Olivia Morris and Jill Roberts.

352
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:34,388
That's Sid's cousin. Damn.

353
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,807
Right in here, Sheriff.

354
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,185
- Hey, Jill.
- Sidney.

355
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:41,061
- Hi.
- Hi.

356
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:43,689
It's nice to see you,
even under the circumstances.

357
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,692
- You OK?
- Yeah.

358
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,820
- So two of you got phone calls?
- Yeah, us two.

359
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:55,075
- "What's your favorite scary movie?"
- It was the killer's voice. From Stab.

360
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:57,745
Or, I mean, you know, from your life.

361
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,456
I'm Kirby, by the way. I'm their friend.

362
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:04,627
- And the killer didn't call you?
- No.

363
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:07,087
Is that a bad thing?

364
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:09,089
Does that mean that I'm not
gonna live as long as these two?

365
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:11,509
No. Maybe.

366
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:16,055
Of course not. Just... Just be careful.

367
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,432
Oh, my God, did you hear that?
I'm gonna be next!

368
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,851
Dewey, I shouldn't be here.
I should leave town.

369
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,895
I'm afraid that's not
really possible, Sidney.

370
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:28,317
Look, nobody thinks you're involved,
but everyone's a suspect. I'm sorry.

371
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:31,487
And there was evidence in your car,
connecting the killer to you.

372
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,072
You may be a material witness.

373
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:39,578
So, look, you'll have
24-hour police surveillance.

374
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:41,080
That's comforting.

375
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,459
This is Rebecca.

376
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:49,213
Oh, my fucking God, Henry!
Yes, it's true.

377
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:52,758
Two girls butchered. Payday.

378
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:56,387
I was so not feeling Woodsboro.
I was like, "lame PR move, right?"

379
00:25:56,555 --> 00:26:02,309
Well, fuck me wow. Best idea ever.
Henry, I'll call you back.

380
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,353
We're gonna have to wrap this up.

381
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:07,648
Excuse me, I have to geek out. I didn't
get a chance to say something earlier,

382
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:10,484
- but it's such an honor to meet you.
- Oh, thank you.

383
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:11,902
- Rebecca Walters.
- Hi.

384
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,114
When I was a kid, it was all about
Top Story with Gale Weathers.

385
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:18,409
- You were my '90s.
- Well, it's Gale Riley now.

386
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:19,994
You gave it all up for love,
I know that.

387
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:21,495
How long have you and Dewey
been married?

388
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,330
- Ten years.
- Oh.

389
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:25,249
Just like your characters in Stab 3.

390
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:28,127
- Wow.
- Wow.

391
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:31,630
I didn't mean bad wow. It just always
seemed like more of a movie romance

392
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:35,342
than a real one, because it was a movie.
In real life you two would never be...

393
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:38,137
Ooh... Dug a hole.

394
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,431
Climbing out here. So, anyway,

395
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,725
kudos on being brave enough
to drop off the professional map.

396
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:45,686
Any plans on revitalizing
your tarnished brand?

397
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:49,189
Listen, in about two seconds,
I'm gonna revitalize your face

398
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:51,358
- with my tarnished brand.
- Ooh.

399
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:54,028
I still got it.

400
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,114
Testy.

401
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,959
She's so pretty. When you think
about what she's survived,

402
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:12,296
- she must have scars everywhere.
- Shh! Come on.

403
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:16,967
Her mom was my sister.
I have scars, too.

404
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,553
No one ever asks me about my scars.

405
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:23,307
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Roberts.
- She means knife scars, Mom.

406
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,977
Oh. Well, fine.

407
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:33,233
How are you? How's Gale?

408
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:36,737
I'm all right.

409
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:40,908
But Gale... It's been hard on her.

410
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:45,412
Small town, small-town husband.

411
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,373
Not much to write about.

412
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:50,417
You two OK?

413
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:54,505
Well, I read somewhere once,

414
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,800
"Just when you think
things can't get any worse,

415
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:01,929
sometimes they don't.
Sometimes they get better. "

416
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:05,641
Out of Darkness by
Sidney Prescott, page 220.

417
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,403
I've gotta get going.

418
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:26,078
It's nice to see you, Dewey.
We've been through a lot together.

419
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,789
And we'll get through this, too. OK?

420
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,083
- Lock up.
- Mm-hm.

421
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:54,481
Be cool. It's OK.
Relax, relax. It's just me.

422
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:57,151
What the hell are you doing here?
There are cops right out front!

423
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:59,737
No match for the ninja, baby.

424
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,742
Anyway, what are you doing in the house
with Sidney Prescott?

425
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,578
I mean, that's like being on Top Chef
with Jeffrey Dahmer.

426
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,164
Can you please get away
from the window?

427
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:13,667
You have no right to be in here.
Not anymore.

428
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,252
Hang on.

429
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,213
I heard you got a phone call
from the killer.

430
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:21,550
- Is that true?
- What do you care?

431
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:24,511
Don't you think you'd be
a lot safer with me around?

432
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:27,431
- I don't trust you, Trevor.
- Hey.

433
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,309
Then I'm just gonna have to
make sure that you do.

434
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:32,686
All right?

435
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:36,356
Oh, sorry. I didn't...

436
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:40,110
- No, he's just leaving. It's my ex.
- Oh.

437
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:43,113
Yeah. Her one and only.

438
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,908
- Hi.
- Hi.

439
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:49,036
It's cool to meet you... officially.

440
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:52,247
I keep meaning to pick up
a copy of your book, but...

441
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:55,125
You're smaller in person.

442
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,635
What?

443
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:09,640
Nothing. You just...
You remind me of... me.

444
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:15,229
- Lock your window, OK?
- Yeah. Good night.

445
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:17,189
Night.

446
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:20,484
Sorry about that.

447
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:24,404
Just making my rounds before taking off.

448
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:26,907
Great. Thanks.

449
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:31,245
You don't remember me, do you?

450
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:35,082
- Sorry?
- We went to high school together.

451
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,542
Judy Hicks.

452
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:40,921
We had the same homeroom.
And drama club, too.

453
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:45,008
We were in Peter Pan together.
I played a Lost Boy.

454
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:49,555
You were... Tiger Lily.

455
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,184
I'm sorry, that was a long time ago.

456
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:56,937
It's OK.

457
00:30:57,105 --> 00:31:01,316
You had a lot of stuff
going on back then.

458
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:04,611
Well, it's nice to see you again, Judy.

459
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,155
You, too.

460
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:14,997
Evertyhing OK upstairs?

461
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:17,332
You're supposed
to be out front, Perkins.

462
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:29,094
What's a four-letter word for courage?

463
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,721
Uh...

464
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:32,806
..."guts. "

465
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:40,147
That's Olivia Morris.
She lives next door.

466
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,899
- She's on the list.
- Yeah.

467
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,319
She can live next door to me.

468
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:49,156
Now seriously, Mary,
I'm warning you, OK?

469
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,700
I'm gonna have to get physical.
I mean it.

470
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,785
This is it! Just fuck off!

471
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:07,257
- Hello?
- What are you guys up to?

472
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,343
We're watching Shaun of the Dead.

473
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,012
You know there are two zombies
sitting outside the house in a car?

474
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:15,182
Yup. They're cops.
You wanna come up?

475
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:19,144
- The Angel of Death leave?
- No, she's in the guest room.

476
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,855
Forget it. Next door's close enough.

477
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:25,192
- Your mom home?
- She's at her boyfriend's.

478
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,361
It's creepy around here tonight.

479
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:32,824
Well, the zombies are still in
their car, so you should be all right.

480
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:35,452
- Call me tomorrow, OK?
- All right.

481
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:38,705
- She didn't wanna come up?
- She fears the Reaper.

482
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:40,791
Watch this.

483
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:50,884
Speaking.

484
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:55,138
What's your favorite
scary movie, Olivia?

485
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,557
That's the worst imitation
I've ever heard, Jill.

486
00:32:57,725 --> 00:33:00,560
Speaking of Stab, have you heard
where the Stab-a-Thon is gonna be yet?

487
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:04,398
No, and it doesn't matter to me anyways.
My mom doesn't let me go.

488
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:11,071
- It's Trevor. I'll handle this.
- Trevor's calling. Again.

489
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:14,574
- What do you want?
- I wanna talk to Jill.

490
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:17,077
Uh, no, it's Kirby. Sorry, Trevor.

491
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:20,080
Jill is screening her calls
from all past relationships.

492
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:23,417
- What's going on over there?
- Hang on a sec. What is he saying?

493
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:26,837
- I'm not Trevor.
- What?

494
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:31,425
- I can barely hear you, Trevor.
- This isn't Trevor.

495
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:36,054
Oh, all right. Well, then why do you
have his phone, whoever this is?

496
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:40,600
- He's trying to do Ghostface.
- He's being weird.

497
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:42,519
I want to talk to Jill.

498
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:45,147
OK, well, she doesn't
wanna talk to you.

499
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:47,649
Come on, Mr. Ghostface, whisper to me.

500
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:50,610
Aren't you supposed
to ask me a question?

501
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:52,029
All right.

502
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:54,740
- How's the movie?
- What movie?

503
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:56,199
Shaun of the Dead.

504
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,619
How did you know that?

505
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:05,042
- Because I'm standing in the closet.
- Stop. You are not.

506
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,586
- What's going on?
- Trevor's being weird.

507
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,755
- I mean, if it is him. I don't know.
- What?

508
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:13,800
- This is not fucking Trevor!
- Well, then who the fuck are you?

509
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:16,470
Open the closet door.

510
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,974
You do know there are cops
all over this house?

511
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:24,311
I think I'd have just enough time
to slice someone open.

512
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:27,397
I'll talk to him.

513
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,568
What's going on over there, you guys?

514
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,654
- Sorry. I don't know. Kirby.
- Shh!

515
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:38,241
- Kirby!
- Come on, do it.

516
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,243
There is no way you're in there.

517
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,662
See for yourself.

518
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:47,584
Kirby... Kirby, come on.
Talk to me. This isn't funny.

519
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,127
Kirby!

520
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,553
Liar. I'm over this.

521
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:00,889
I never said I was in your closet.

522
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,057
Wha...?

523
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:09,147
- Oh, my God!
- Olivia!

524
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:12,818
Help, somebody!

525
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,281
Stop!

526
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:25,288
Help!

527
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,667
No! Don't! No! Help!

528
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:44,057
- Hoss! Perkins!
- Somebody help!

529
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,309
Shit!

530
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:51,189
Help! Help!

531
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,737
Come on, help!

532
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,201
Stop it!

533
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,576
- What?
- Welcome home, Sidney.

534
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,703
Preview of coming events.

535
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,955
Why don't you come for me?
You got the balls for that?

536
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:51,625
Oh, poor Sidney.
You think this is all about you.

537
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:55,128
- You think you're still the star.
- This isn't a fucking movie!

538
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:57,047
- It will be.
- These are innocent people.

539
00:36:57,215 --> 00:37:00,926
Spare me the lecture. You've done very
well by all this bloodshed, haven't you?

540
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:05,222
Well, how about the town you
left behind? I've got plans for you.

541
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,140
I'm gonna slit your eyelids in half

542
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:10,060
so you don't blink
when I stab you in the face.

543
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,604
You'll die when I want you to, Sidney.

544
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:17,734
Not a moment before.
Until then, you're going to suffer.

545
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:22,656
- Sidney!
- Jill! Stay right there!

546
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:25,742
- Is she...?
- Do not look. OK?

547
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,495
She said you were the Angel of Death.

548
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:30,497
Look out!

549
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:54,020
He's in here.

550
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,273
Where is he?

551
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:00,193
He was.

552
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,611
What is your status?

553
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,364
Jill?

554
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,449
Don't.

555
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:18,169
What happened?
Oh, my God, Jill!

556
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,215
Jesus!

557
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:26,177
Baby, baby. I'm here. Come on, let's go.
I'm gonna take care of you, all right?

558
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:27,554
Here. I got it.

559
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:31,057
Jill? Oh, my God. Are you OK?

560
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:34,477
- Here, keep pressure on it.
- There's nobody back there.

561
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,814
- Call it in.
- Right.

562
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:40,942
Hey. Are you OK?

563
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,404
You should look upstairs.

564
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:57,751
Let's get the coroner's van
brought around, please.

565
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,591
I thought this was over.

566
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:11,681
- It's all your fault, Sidney.
- You're just like your mother!

567
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:15,101
You folks go home. Come on.

568
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:19,856
- Get out of the street, please.
- I'm sorry about what I said.

569
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,568
Do you wanna go get that looked at?

570
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:25,862
Yeah.

571
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,782
What the hell happened?

572
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:32,660
OK. I saw him go into that yard
two houses down right before...

573
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:34,954
Yeah, and I circled around
to cut him off.

574
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:38,166
- And?
- And I met Hoss coming

575
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,794
- from the other direction.
- He circled back around somehow.

576
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:44,589
- He's like a ghost.
- Chief, we're sorry.

577
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:49,010
- We feel terrible.
- All right. Get outta here.

578
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:06,361
This is Hall Pass with Robbie Mercer,
webcasting live in our darkest hour.

579
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:09,948
What began as a day of remembrance
has ended with serial murder.

580
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:13,827
Olivia Morris, who officially
will never go out with me, is dead.

581
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:16,162
So is Jenny Randall and Marnie Cooper.

582
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:19,916
Our local legacy, the Stab movies,
is coming to life.

583
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,669
Excuse me.
Are you recording with that thing?

584
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,505
Live video-blog upload.
He's webcasting right now.

585
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:28,550
Mind turning it off for a little
old-school off the record?

586
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:32,178
- Can't. Owe it to my audience.
- Turn that fucking thing off.

587
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:33,805
OK.

588
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:38,810
So you two are the boys that run
the movie club at Woodsboro High, huh?

589
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:42,188
Charlie runs it.
I'm just VP, in case he takes a bullet.

590
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:45,692
- It's called Cinema Club.
- So you must have a very unique insight

591
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:50,363
- into the movie buffs at your school.
- Maybe.

592
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:54,993
What if we could catch the killer
by working together?

593
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,162
Two generations
of cutting-edge journalists

594
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:59,873
intertwining our passions for media?

595
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:03,877
- What would you say?
- I love you.

596
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:05,753
Very good.

597
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:09,591
Now, you give me your expertise on
the gore geek scene at Woodsboro High,

598
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:12,385
and maybe I give you
something in return.

599
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:17,390
Say a celebrity visit
to your Cinema Club? By me.

600
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:22,520
- What about Sidney?
- What about Sidney?

601
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,814
Yeah, you know her, right?
I mean, you're friends with her.

602
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:28,735
No offense, but that'd be
a big deal for Cinema Club.

603
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:31,321
A visit from Sidney Prescott?
I mean, she's the star.

604
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,906
Ooh.

605
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:35,825
Yes, she's Daniel Radcliffe
to my J.K. Rowling.

606
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:38,495
Without the book sales
and the box office.

607
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,830
Whatever.

608
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:46,794
There's no broken bones.
I think you'll be fine. I would just...

609
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:48,546
...take a couple weeks off.

610
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,384
So, Sidney... Ooh, ow.

611
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:58,515
Anyway, long story short, Random wants
to lock you in to three more books now.

612
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:02,060
See the blank line in your contract?
You can name your price.

613
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:04,187
And, as soon as you're clear
in this investigation,

614
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,939
we're on the next plane to New York.

615
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:08,900
I booked Today, The View,
Nancy Grace, MTV News...

616
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:11,611
- Excuse me. Can I ask you a question?
- Mm.

617
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,821
Did you read my book?

618
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:16,824
Thought I'd wait for the movie.

619
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:20,245
- Book tour's over.
- Sidney.

620
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:23,039
Accept your situation.

621
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:28,461
You're a victim. For life.
So embrace it, use it.

622
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:32,507
I know you care about your readers.
All those little downtrodden fucks

623
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:35,468
that need a light at the end of their
tunnel so they don't jump off a bridge.

624
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:40,181
And a lucky break like this? I'm talking
100 percent increase in sales, minimum.

625
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:42,350
That's maybe a million more people
get your message,

626
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:45,144
and you get a ton more checks. Win-win.

627
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:48,982
I won't be needing you anymore.

628
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:51,484
- Sidney.
- You're fired.

629
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,444
- Fired?
- Fired.

630
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,406
Fine.

631
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,388
"Have you
even read my book, Rebecca?"

632
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,945
The problem with Sidney
is that she never gets laid.

633
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:38,656
Or even a little shit-faced
once in a while.

634
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:43,161
She'll call me tonight and apologize.
Just watch.

635
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,086
She'll come around.

636
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:56,966
Gotta just give her time,
Sidney will come around.

637
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,011
Where did I...?

638
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:05,808
Ah.

639
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:12,065
- This is Rebecca.
- Sidney Prescott, please.

640
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:15,652
I'm handling Miss Prescott's calls
and appearances. May I take a message?

641
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:18,112
You are the message.

642
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:24,994
- Are you writing this down?
- Yes, I am.

643
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:27,914
It's kind of hard to hear you.
I'm in the hospital with Sidney.

644
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:31,918
- If you could just hang on one second.
- I've got time.

645
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:34,087
It's you that doesn't.

646
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:45,598
You know, Rebecca, it doesn't sound
to me like you're in the hospital.

647
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:48,601
Sounds like you're in a parking garage.

648
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:52,897
A dark and deserted parking garage.

649
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:57,276
But if you want to be in the hospital,
I'd be happy to put you there.

650
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:59,362
In the morgue!

651
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:17,422
Shit...

652
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:23,261
No!

653
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:47,827
Help!

654
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:50,163
Help! Help me!

655
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:52,373
Help!

656
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:08,514
Cut and run, you fucking bastard!

657
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:19,418
This is an ongoing investigation.

658
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,589
Rest assured,
we're pursuing a number of leads.

659
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:25,508
The less I say about that, the better.

660
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:28,344
- Sheriff...
- So I'm taking questions.

661
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:29,512
Sheriff!

662
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,514
- Dewey!
- Gale?

663
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:34,225
Any comment on the fact
that these killings seem to resemble

664
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:37,186
the pattern of the original
Woodsboro Murders?

665
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:40,189
- Hon? Later.
- Wha...?

666
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:41,607
What was that, Sheriff?

667
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:45,444
As I was saying,
my officers are hard at work,

668
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:48,114
and we just want the community to know

669
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:51,701
that we are very close to bringing
this whole situation under control...

670
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:53,244
Ahh!

671
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:00,126
All right, someone,

672
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:02,587
get up to the
top of the structure! Go, go!

673
00:48:02,754 --> 00:48:05,298
- Everyone, back! Stay back!
- All right, nobody move!

674
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:07,341
Listen,
I want a man on each stairwell.

675
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:12,972
- Do you see anybody?
- Nobody up here.

676
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,016
There's nobody
up there, Sheriff!

677
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:18,728
It's all under control, huh, Sheriff?

678
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,938
What am I supposed to say?

679
00:48:21,106 --> 00:48:22,982
Listen, I may not be wearing a uniform,

680
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:25,735
but I happen to have a lead
and you don't.

681
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,739
So let me know when
you're back on Team Gale.

682
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:33,576
Move it, amateurs!

683
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:47,423
OK, Cinema Club.
We are now in session. Welcome.

684
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:50,343
Tell you a little bit about ourselves.
We are a sanctioned

685
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:53,804
after-school activity,
one rung below the Glee Club,

686
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:56,182
two above Nintendo Wii Fit.

687
00:48:56,350 --> 00:49:02,021
And let me just say to our guest,
Sidney Prescott, it's an honor.

688
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:09,487
Beyond Jamie Lee Curtis, forget Linda
Blair, I mean, this is the ultimate.

689
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:12,198
Thanks. I guess. Um...

690
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:14,867
This? You film your
entire high school experience,

691
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:17,954
- and what, post it on the Net?
- Everybody'll be doing it someday, Sid.

692
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:20,539
It's kind of the one component
the killer's missing.

693
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:22,083
Wait. What do you mean?

694
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:25,711
Well, if you wanna be
the new-new version.

695
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:27,213
The killer should be
filming the murders.

696
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:30,383
Yeah, it's the natural next step
in a psycho slasher innovation.

697
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,969
I mean, you film them all real time,
and then before you get caught,

698
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:36,430
- you upload them into cyberspace.
- Making your art as immortal as you.

699
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:39,475
- Not to implicate him.
- Not to implicate me.

700
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,560
So who do you think
is behind the murders?

701
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:45,356
Well,
it's a Stab fanatic, clearly.

702
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:48,150
Working on less of a shriekquel
and more of a scream-make.

703
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:50,695
- Copyrighted terms, by the way.
- 'Cause all there are now are remakes.

704
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:53,239
Only horror the studios green light.

705
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,907
- I mean, there are still rules...
- Psst!

706
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:57,910
...but the rules have changed.
The unexpected is the new cliché.

707
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:00,705
Yeah, you gotta have an opening
sequence that blows the doors off,

708
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:02,832
dial up some flashy
music-video direction,

709
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,583
and the kills gotta be way more extreme.

710
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:07,753
Modern audiences get savvy
to the rules of the originals,

711
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:09,588
so the reversals
become the new standard.

712
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:13,426
In fact, the only surefire way
to survive a modern horror movie?

713
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:15,136
You pretty much have to be gay.

714
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:22,268
So why are you so sure that the killer's
working by the rules of a horror remake?

715
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:24,270
The original Stab structure
is pretty apparent.

716
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:26,939
Yeah, two kids killed in a house
when their parents are away...

717
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:29,608
And then the school's hot chick
"savaged beyond recognition. "

718
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:32,069
- We all know where it goes from there.
- A party.

719
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:35,114
Exactly. A party.

720
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:37,616
Guaranteed third act
main cast bloodbath.

721
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:39,285
Fingers crossed
on some nudity for a change.

722
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:44,165
OK, so do you know of a party
that's happening tonight?

723
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,626
Well, there's Stab-a-Thon.

724
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:51,422
- Stab-a-Thon?
- It's a movie marathon.

725
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,841
All seven Stabs back-to-back.
We do it every year.

726
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:57,887
And it's tonight? There's a killer
out there patterning his murders

727
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:00,806
- after the original movie.
- I know. It's pretty wild.

728
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:04,935
- Well, you have to call it off.
- OK, I mean, it's Friday.

729
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:07,646
I'm sure we're not the only party
that's going on in Woodsboro.

730
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:09,815
OK, where is this
circle jerk gonna take place?

731
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:11,817
So who's ready for this Q & A?

732
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:14,278
No, no. I really want the location.

733
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:18,074
You know, it's kind of an underground
thing. Email invites, pretty secret.

734
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:21,994
What, you're not
gonna tell me? Really?

735
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:25,790
We're working together. Remember?

736
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:30,294
- So are you ready for that Q & A?
- Fuck you. Let's go.

737
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:35,841
That was awesome.

738
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:37,676
Nobody comes or goes unless we say...

739
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:40,930
- You got it.
- I feel like I'm under house arrest.

740
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:58,906
You know when people say,
"I know how you feel"...

741
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:03,202
...but you know they're just saying that
because they really have

742
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,871
no frigging idea how you feel?

743
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,459
I know how you feel.

744
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:16,507
I am... so sorry about Olivia.

745
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,597
I'm sorry about your publicist.

746
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:33,274
How do you handle it?
People staring at you all the time?

747
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:35,609
People stare at me?

748
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:40,573
I could never handle that
kind of attention. I just...

749
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:43,242
...feel like it would
take over your whole life.

750
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:53,711
What I do is I...
try not to think about me.

751
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:59,091
I have people I care about,
I focus on them.

752
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:03,929
And the rest, it works out.

753
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,684
You saved my life last night.

754
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:12,229
I mean, I know we're family,
but you hardly know me.

755
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:15,065
It makes me wonder, you know,

756
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:18,360
if I'd have been brave enough
to do the same thing.

757
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:23,365
I really hope you never
have to find that out.

758
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:29,788
Well, if you need me,
you know where to find me.

759
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:33,792
I'll be up in my cell.
Or, I mean, my room.

760
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:00,945
Her room's all boarded up.
That's the view from my cell.

761
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:03,906
It's really weird.

762
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:05,616
I think Olivia
would understand, OK?

763
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:07,493
She'd want me
to be around other people.

764
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:12,248
Holy shit. Even if I did just
crash-land on Planet Dork.

765
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:16,961
- Speaking of which, Trevor's here.
- Hey, Kirby.

766
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:19,546
What is he doing there?
That is so not his scene.

767
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:22,132
I have no idea.
Maybe he thought you would be here.

768
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,593
Yeah, fat chance.
After what happened last night?

769
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:27,930
I mean, my mom is just completely
freaked out. It's not pretty.

770
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:29,723
All right, look.
You go do your good girl thing,

771
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:33,018
and I will drink for the both of us.
I will keep you posted.

772
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:35,729
All right. Be safe.

773
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:46,991
Yeah, check it out!

774
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:00,504
- Hey!
- Hey!

775
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:03,716
- Here, stab me!
- Kill him like a bitch, dude!

776
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:05,384
I'm not the one who
got the number, man.

777
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:06,927
Whoa!

778
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:24,528
Stab-a-Thon! Stab-a-Thon!
Stab-a-Thon! Stab-a-Thon!

779
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:26,405
Thank you! Thank you!

780
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:28,907
Shh!

781
00:55:29,784 --> 00:55:33,037
Cinema Club thanks you for coming out
for our third annual Stab-a-Thon.

782
00:55:33,204 --> 00:55:35,331
Safety in numbers, my friends!
Safety in numbers!

783
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:37,333
Who's ready to drink every time
someone can't get a cell phone signal?

784
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:41,795
Who's ready to drink every time
someone shuts the refrigerator door,

785
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:45,215
and, oh, my God, there's
a harmless character right behind it?

786
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:48,594
Who's ready to drink every time
someone screams the word...

787
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,262
No!

788
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:54,141
Let's get this Stab-a-Thon started!

789
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:11,617
- Hey, watch it!
- Out of the way!

790
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:13,911
Down in front!

791
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:17,206
- Move your ass!
- Screw you!

792
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:55,452
Yes.

793
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:04,336
Oh, yeah. Back on my game.

794
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:06,922
Perfect.

795
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,341
New work in progress, chapter one.

796
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:12,302
When I moved to Woodsboro,
I never in a million years

797
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:16,432
dreamed that I would again
play the critical role

798
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:18,517
in solving another series of these...

799
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:21,270
What?

800
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:29,236
What the hell?

801
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:53,469
Gale, where are you?

802
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:56,054
I followed the kids to the Stab-a-Thon.

803
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:58,974
There's an old abandoned farm
on Fort Dillon Road.

804
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:01,560
Listen, I've got it under surveillance,
but I think the killer's

805
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:04,688
- about to make his move.
- What makes you so sure?

806
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:09,234
You do a remake to out-do the original,
that's what the kids said.

807
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:13,739
This party is all about the Stab movies.
Come on! How meta can you get?

808
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:18,118
- How "what-a" can you get?
- I don't know. I heard them say it.

809
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:21,163
Dewey, listen to me,
you have to get out here!

810
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:24,416
Come on, you catch the killer,
I get the story. It's a win-win.

811
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:27,002
Well, I thought
you were going rogue, Gale.

812
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,922
Oh, come... Are you serious? Come on!

813
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:33,342
Forget it.
Thanks for having faith in me.

814
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:36,345
- I gotta fix my equipment.
- Gale!

815
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:41,391
Shit.

816
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:50,234
You uncomfortable, baby?

817
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:59,618
Bravo. Very well done.
I'm very impressed.

818
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:02,788
I mean, kind of impressed. Not really.

819
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:04,206
- That'll do.
- Yeah?

820
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:06,375
- Yeah, she wants me.
- Yeah. Yeah.

821
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,795
Whoo!

822
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:11,838
No!

823
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:16,426
Ghostface, yeah!

824
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:22,849
Don't answer it!

825
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:27,896
- Hello?
- Hello.

826
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:31,066
- Who is this?
- Were you expecting somebody?

827
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:32,234
- No.
- No.

828
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:42,995
You know, I don't even know you,
and I dislike you already.

829
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:45,455
Hicks, how far are you
from Fort Dillon Road?

830
00:59:45,623 --> 00:59:48,041
- Five minutes at the most, sir.
- Well, step on it.

831
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:51,878
Look out your window.

832
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:39,635
Gale! Gale, behind you!

833
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:57,569
Gale!

834
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:13,835
Freeze!

835
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:29,226
Get out of the way, you morons!

836
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,691
Damn it!

837
01:01:38,986 --> 01:01:40,737
OK, put pressure on that.

838
01:01:40,905 --> 01:01:43,490
- Did you catch him?
- No.

839
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:45,784
Hopefully, your cameras got something.

840
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:47,619
- They weren't the only ones, Dewey.
- What?

841
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:50,122
There's a webcam that's hidden up there.

842
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:53,375
- It was watching me.
- A webcam?

843
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:56,461
- He's recording the murders.
- What?

844
01:01:56,629 --> 01:02:00,215
This time... he's making the movie.

845
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:09,266
Sidney Prescott detail, man.
I don't like it.

846
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:12,477
The cops guarding the house,
they always get it.

847
01:02:13,312 --> 01:02:15,772
- What are you talking about?
- It's a movie cop rule.

848
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:18,400
It sucks to be a cop in a movie,
unless you're Bruce Willis.

849
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:21,528
Not all cops die in movies.

850
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:26,074
No, but if it's your last day
before retirement, you do.

851
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:30,036
If you're a rookie and just found out
your wife is pregnant, you do.

852
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:33,874
Or if your partner is better looking
than you, you do. And, by the way,

853
01:02:34,041 --> 01:02:36,042
- I win that one.
- I win that one.

854
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:40,172
You know what? I'll take the
next perimeter. I'll be right back.

855
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:45,343
Shit. I know this one.

856
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:47,262
You're not supposed to say that,
are you?

857
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:51,308
New decade, new rules. You know, these
days, you might come back, find me dead.

858
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:54,644
Eyes gouged out, tongue sticking out.
Could go either way.

859
01:02:54,812 --> 01:02:57,147
- I gotta learn this shit.
- Ha.

860
01:02:57,315 --> 01:02:59,024
I'll take this one.

861
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,152
Hey, Hoss.

862
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:06,198
- Be careful.
- I'm always careful.

863
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:12,037
Dead man walking.

864
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:05,006
Perkins, was there a window open
on your last perimeter check?

865
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,845
Perkins, come in, over.

866
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:41,626
Anthony?

867
01:04:42,753 --> 01:04:44,421
Perkins?

868
01:04:46,173 --> 01:04:48,049
Ahh!

869
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:50,552
Damn it.

870
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,555
You should've seen the look
on your face, rookie.

871
01:04:54,765 --> 01:04:57,058
Hoss! What the fuck?

872
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:58,685
Ahh!

873
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:01,271
Oh, shit.

874
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:31,051
Fuck Bruce Willis.

875
01:05:59,246 --> 01:06:02,791
Sorry! The wind chimes were over here.

876
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:05,418
It was me.
I was trying to fix them, sorry.

877
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:10,006
- I'm just back from the store.
- You're shopping?

878
01:06:10,174 --> 01:06:13,468
My stress buster.
I've got one more bag in the car.

879
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:15,261
I'll be right back.

880
01:06:40,746 --> 01:06:42,747
Jill? You gonna get that?

881
01:06:46,627 --> 01:06:47,585
Roberts residence.

882
01:06:47,753 --> 01:06:50,130
You're a survivor,
aren't you, Sidney?

883
01:06:50,297 --> 01:06:53,466
Your one and only skill. You survive.

884
01:06:53,634 --> 01:06:55,802
I have one question for you:

885
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:58,346
What good's it to be a survivor
in this little drama,

886
01:06:58,514 --> 01:07:00,765
if everyone close to you is dead?

887
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,518
- Who are you?
- Turn on the TV to channel six.

888
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:07,939
- Who the fuck are you?!
- Turn it on. Watch the teaser.

889
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:12,610
...nearly turned deadly tonight with
the latest victims of these attacks

890
01:07:12,778 --> 01:07:17,866
being the wife of the Woodsboro sheriff,
Gale Riley, aka Gale Weathers,

891
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:20,535
who's in serious condition tonight
after being stabbed.

892
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:23,288
Her assailant then disappeared
in a sea of identical...

893
01:07:24,957 --> 01:07:27,584
Glad you came home, Sidney?
Has it been worth it yet?

894
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:29,836
- Why are you doing this?
- Friends count,

895
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:35,133
but it's the family ties that cut deep,
Am I right?

896
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:38,511
- What do you mean?
- The ones you care about most.

897
01:07:38,679 --> 01:07:42,098
And what's closer than family?
The bond of blood.

898
01:07:42,266 --> 01:07:44,267
- Don't.
- You can't save them.

899
01:07:44,435 --> 01:07:47,729
All you can do is watch.

900
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:49,481
Jill!

901
01:08:00,326 --> 01:08:01,993
Come on. Why won't it come on?

902
01:08:08,292 --> 01:08:09,876
- Kate?
- Sid?

903
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:11,836
- Jill's not in her room.
- Oh, my God!

904
01:08:12,004 --> 01:08:13,797
She's gone to Kirby's. You gotta
call her and get her back here.

905
01:08:13,964 --> 01:08:15,215
OK.

906
01:08:16,675 --> 01:08:18,593
- Come on, Jill!
- Leave a message.

907
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:21,179
She's not picking up. What's going on?

908
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:22,972
The killer called.
He's coming after me,

909
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:25,350
- but he wants my family first.
- Oh, God, Jill!

910
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:27,602
- Let's get the cops.
- The cops aren't there.

911
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:29,187
- What?
- They were there when I first came in,

912
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:32,482
- but they're not there now.
- Let's get to Kirby's.

913
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:37,570
Out the front!

914
01:08:45,663 --> 01:08:48,414
Brace it from the bottom! Can you?

915
01:08:54,421 --> 01:08:55,338
Let's get out of here!

916
01:08:56,549 --> 01:08:59,634
Kate, come on! Kate?

917
01:09:10,729 --> 01:09:15,650
- Tell Jill I'm so sorry.
- No, no, no, no.

918
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:28,496
Kate...

919
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:46,055
Hicks! What are you doing?

920
01:09:46,223 --> 01:09:48,683
I just saw somebody coming
around the side of the house.

921
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:50,894
Where are Hoss and Perkins?
I couldn't get them on the radio.

922
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:56,608
- Whose blood is that?
- It's Kate's. We were just attacked.

923
01:09:56,775 --> 01:09:58,610
- She's dead.
- Where is she?

924
01:09:58,777 --> 01:10:00,778
- Front door.
- Show me.

925
01:10:00,946 --> 01:10:02,322
OK.

926
01:10:06,118 --> 01:10:08,119
- Stay here.
- OK.

927
01:10:13,125 --> 01:10:17,670
This is Deputy Hicks. I've got a
homicide at the Roberts residence.

928
01:10:17,838 --> 01:10:19,464
No sign of Perkins or Hoss.

929
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:21,216
Copy that.
We'll try to locate them.

930
01:10:21,383 --> 01:10:22,467
I'm so sorry.

931
01:10:33,646 --> 01:10:37,148
You're gonna be fine, all right?
I swear.

932
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:40,568
No more "on your own. "
It's you and me, forever.

933
01:10:40,736 --> 01:10:42,570
One, two, three.

934
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:44,113
Easy.

935
01:10:45,532 --> 01:10:47,325
- Dewey?
- Yeah?

936
01:10:48,619 --> 01:10:51,537
- Promise me something.
- Anything.

937
01:10:52,998 --> 01:10:54,958
Catch that motherfucker.

938
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:59,629
- Absolutely. I love you.
- I love you.

939
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:04,300
You missed chaos. Utter chaos.

940
01:11:04,468 --> 01:11:07,345
- I can't believe that.
- The sheriff's wife, man!

941
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:09,639
She told us to cancel it,
and we didn't, and now this?

942
01:11:09,807 --> 01:11:12,684
- What are we supposed to do?
- Robbie, calm down. It makes sense.

943
01:11:12,851 --> 01:11:15,645
This is what the reboots do.
They one-up the original ending.

944
01:11:15,813 --> 01:11:18,856
The Woodsboro Murders ended at a party.
So in the remake...

945
01:11:19,024 --> 01:11:21,609
The party's the false ending. New rules.

946
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:23,528
Exactly.

947
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:25,863
OK, no offense, guys,
but I'm gonna put in Stab 7.

948
01:11:26,031 --> 01:11:27,490
- Yes!
- Nobody cancels my film festival.

949
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:30,868
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I don't wanna watch
that, not after what happened to Olivia.

950
01:11:31,036 --> 01:11:35,331
- Come on, it was her favorite.
- Wow, Kirby.

951
01:11:35,499 --> 01:11:37,250
- You got some classics here.
- Yup.

952
01:11:37,418 --> 01:11:39,043
Suspiria, Don't Look Now.

953
01:11:39,211 --> 01:11:43,131
You know it. I could trivia your ass
under the table, Cinema Boy.

954
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:44,674
Oh, yeah?

955
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:47,510
- Who played Leatherface first?
- Gunnar Hansen.

956
01:11:47,678 --> 01:11:50,638
Wow. Did you feel that?

957
01:11:52,057 --> 01:11:53,391
That charge that moved
between us just then?

958
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:58,146
- Oh, that was me. I have powers.
- So sexy.

959
01:11:58,314 --> 01:12:01,858
You guys are unbelievable.
You're playing fucking trivia games?

960
01:12:02,026 --> 01:12:04,402
The cops are gonna come for us.
They're gonna shut down my website.

961
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:06,738
- We're so dead!
- Yeah. I agree.

962
01:12:06,905 --> 01:12:09,615
- Jesus Christ, where'd you come from?
- The front door.

963
01:12:09,783 --> 01:12:12,285
By the way, Kirby, with evertyhing
that's going on right now,

964
01:12:12,453 --> 01:12:14,537
you probably
shouldn't leave that unlocked.

965
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:16,414
Sorry.

966
01:12:16,582 --> 01:12:20,084
And, may I ask, what
the hell you're doing here?

967
01:12:20,252 --> 01:12:22,754
What? Didn't I find the afterparty?

968
01:12:22,921 --> 01:12:25,882
No, you found the anti-party,
and it's invitation only.

969
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:29,218
Yeah, well, I got an invitation.
From Jill.

970
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:35,266
- So, what's the story?
- What?

971
01:12:35,434 --> 01:12:39,771
You sent me a text message.
"Afterparty at Kirby's house. "

972
01:12:40,397 --> 01:12:44,150
- I mean, it was from your phone.
- What do you mean, from my phone?

973
01:12:44,318 --> 01:12:45,943
Where is my phone?

974
01:12:46,111 --> 01:12:49,781
I think I left it in your car.
I didn't text him.

975
01:12:49,948 --> 01:12:54,035
I didn't text you. And I'll prove it.

976
01:12:55,412 --> 01:12:57,997
So Charlie, Robbie.

977
01:12:58,165 --> 01:13:00,750
How does it feel
to be accessories to a crime, huh?

978
01:13:00,918 --> 01:13:04,462
- I mean, really, Dewey's wife?
- My life is over.

979
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:07,590
So which one of you guys sent me
a text message from Jill's phone?

980
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:13,012
We're just supposed to accept
that you're telling the truth?

981
01:13:13,972 --> 01:13:15,598
Isn't your phone missing?

982
01:13:16,308 --> 01:13:18,434
- Got a new one.
- Really?

983
01:13:18,602 --> 01:13:21,187
Oh, that's incredibly convenient.

984
01:13:22,481 --> 01:13:25,316
- Dewey, it's Hicks.
- What's up?

985
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:28,903
Kate Roberts is dead,
and Sidney fled the scene.

986
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:31,155
What? What happened to Kate?

987
01:13:31,323 --> 01:13:33,241
She was stabbed just like the others.

988
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:36,160
- What about Jill?
- No sign of her at all.

989
01:13:36,328 --> 01:13:38,454
Where the hell were Hoss and Perkins?

990
01:13:38,622 --> 01:13:41,541
They were found dead
in their car two blocks away.

991
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:46,254
- Multiple stab wounds.
- OK.

992
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:50,383
- I'm on my way.
- Yes, sir.

993
01:13:57,850 --> 01:13:58,891
Wrong number.

994
01:13:59,893 --> 01:14:02,019
- Who was that?
- Nobody.

995
01:14:02,187 --> 01:14:04,188
- Did you pick a movie?
- Yeah.

996
01:14:04,356 --> 01:14:06,023
We're gonna go scary. Saw IV.

997
01:14:06,191 --> 01:14:08,609
I saw that
in theaters. It sucks.

998
01:14:08,777 --> 01:14:10,403
It's not scary, it's gross.

999
01:14:15,534 --> 01:14:18,286
Well, I liked it, so I...

1000
01:14:35,804 --> 01:14:38,764
Charlie, you wanna
sit over here next to me?

1001
01:14:40,017 --> 01:14:41,684
All right.

1002
01:14:46,273 --> 01:14:51,402
All right, get ready for a Hall Pass
with Robbie Mercer extra.

1003
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:55,907
Now, tonight, there is a good chance
that Charlie Walker,

1004
01:14:56,074 --> 01:15:00,745
yes, my Charlie Walker,
may get lucky with a girl.

1005
01:15:01,205 --> 01:15:04,582
Now, I'm unable
to divulge my exact location,

1006
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:08,085
however, suffice it to say

1007
01:15:08,253 --> 01:15:12,924
Woodsboro High may be in store
for some geek history.

1008
01:15:13,091 --> 01:15:14,091
We'll see.

1009
01:15:28,148 --> 01:15:29,649
Hello?

1010
01:15:32,486 --> 01:15:33,945
Who's there?

1011
01:15:39,117 --> 01:15:41,327
Oh, my God!

1012
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:57,969
- Where are you going?
- To make sure the front door is locked.

1013
01:16:00,138 --> 01:16:03,140
- No. Don't open it.
- You're overreacting.

1014
01:16:05,936 --> 01:16:07,436
- Hey, Charlie.
- Yeah?

1015
01:16:09,189 --> 01:16:12,483
I'm sorry. I know you're
into the movie and all, but...

1016
01:16:12,651 --> 01:16:15,820
...now would be a really good time
to make a move.

1017
01:16:16,989 --> 01:16:19,407
For me to make a move?

1018
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:21,158
Uh-hm.

1019
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:26,622
- Couldn't you make a move?
- I just did.

1020
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:30,459
'Cause you're actually pretty cute.

1021
01:16:30,627 --> 01:16:36,424
Especially when I'm scared
and lonely and drunk.

1022
01:16:39,052 --> 01:16:43,431
Hey, guys, did you see Jill come in?
I didn't see her outside.

1023
01:16:44,641 --> 01:16:47,018
Yes, Trevor, she is upstairs.

1024
01:16:47,185 --> 01:16:50,855
Thank God you're here to protect her,
when you can't even find her.

1025
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:53,316
There's nobody out here.

1026
01:16:53,483 --> 01:16:56,402
Oh, dude, I love this part of the movie.

1027
01:16:57,154 --> 01:17:00,364
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just when
you think they're all safe

1028
01:17:00,532 --> 01:17:05,036
and comfortable in the house,
Ghostface comes in and bam!

1029
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:11,167
Did I just interrupt
something right here?

1030
01:17:12,377 --> 01:17:14,670
Shut the fuck up!

1031
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:21,093
- Who invited you, Trevor?
- All right. Clearly not you.

1032
01:17:21,762 --> 01:17:25,222
Wow. I'm gonna be upstairs, laughing.

1033
01:17:25,390 --> 01:17:28,142
Get out of my house!

1034
01:17:30,604 --> 01:17:32,271
Yeah, yeah...

1035
01:17:32,814 --> 01:17:37,026
OK, I'm a little drunk,
so don't blame your Internet connection.

1036
01:17:37,235 --> 01:17:40,071
Let's see what Charlie's up to,
shall we?

1037
01:17:40,238 --> 01:17:45,242
Or the saga of Trevor and Jill.
Oh, the intrigue of Woodsboro High.

1038
01:17:45,410 --> 01:17:48,245
Who needs a killer around
when there's so much drama?

1039
01:18:02,594 --> 01:18:04,178
Oh, man.

1040
01:18:05,764 --> 01:18:06,931
Yeah...

1041
01:18:07,391 --> 01:18:08,724
That's better.

1042
01:18:22,447 --> 01:18:25,074
Wait, no, you can't!
You can't! There's rules!

1043
01:18:25,242 --> 01:18:27,201
I'm gay! I'm gay!

1044
01:18:28,412 --> 01:18:30,287
I mean, if it helps.

1045
01:18:37,629 --> 01:18:39,296
...random girl
who gets a call that undoubtedly

1046
01:18:39,464 --> 01:18:40,381
ends up getting her killed.

1047
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:43,843
That's so predictable. There's no
element of surprise. You can see...

1048
01:18:58,817 --> 01:19:02,153
Kirby! I found my phone.
It was up in your room.

1049
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:05,906
There was no text message
sent to Trevor. He is such a liar.

1050
01:19:07,117 --> 01:19:09,618
- Where is he?
- What do you mean, where is he?

1051
01:19:09,786 --> 01:19:14,123
- He just went upstairs looking for you.
- He's not upstairs.

1052
01:19:15,208 --> 01:19:16,709
Trevor?

1053
01:19:19,171 --> 01:19:21,172
Charlie? Robbie?

1054
01:19:22,174 --> 01:19:24,467
Maybe they're outside.

1055
01:19:24,634 --> 01:19:26,135
- Jill?
- Sidney!

1056
01:19:26,303 --> 01:19:28,679
- I'm sorry, I should've told you...
- No, it's OK.

1057
01:19:28,847 --> 01:19:30,973
I need you to come with me.
Come with me right now, OK?

1058
01:19:32,058 --> 01:19:33,642
Oh, God!

1059
01:19:33,810 --> 01:19:35,728
- Run!
- Robbie!

1060
01:19:39,357 --> 01:19:40,483
Go!

1061
01:19:43,195 --> 01:19:44,528
Sidney!

1062
01:19:46,364 --> 01:19:47,490
Come on!

1063
01:19:51,286 --> 01:19:53,329
- The balcony!
- There's no other way out?

1064
01:19:53,497 --> 01:19:55,289
We can jump!

1065
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:58,793
It's two stories! Where's your cell?

1066
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,336
- Here.
- Get under the bed!

1067
01:20:00,504 --> 01:20:01,754
- What?
- Just do what I say! Get under the bed,

1068
01:20:01,922 --> 01:20:05,049
don't make a sound and don't come out
until I come get you, OK? Trust me.

1069
01:20:05,217 --> 01:20:06,550
OK.

1070
01:20:13,558 --> 01:20:17,645
You got it? You're OK?
Jill, run! Just keep running, get help!

1071
01:20:43,338 --> 01:20:44,255
- Hello?
- Dewey!

1072
01:20:44,422 --> 01:20:46,799
- Sidney, where are you?
- I'm at Kirby's.

1073
01:20:46,967 --> 01:20:49,260
- The killer is here. I need your help.
- I'm on my way.

1074
01:20:49,427 --> 01:20:50,886
OK.

1075
01:20:53,056 --> 01:20:54,682
Sidney? Sidney!

1076
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:57,685
I need all units to 329 Whispering Lane.

1077
01:20:57,853 --> 01:21:00,104
All units, 329 Whispering Lane!

1078
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:23,961
Sorry, it's just me. Look, I tried
to call 911, but the landline's dead,

1079
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:26,297
- and someone smashed the router.
- I think I got through on my cell.

1080
01:21:26,464 --> 01:21:28,674
Where's Jill?

1081
01:21:28,842 --> 01:21:31,302
- Oh, God! Go, go, go!
- Get in.

1082
01:21:35,098 --> 01:21:37,766
There's a room down here.
We can lock ourselves in.

1083
01:21:37,934 --> 01:21:39,977
I heard you yelling to Jill.
Did she get away?

1084
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:41,729
I think she's safe.

1085
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:52,489
- Kirby, let me in!
- Charlie.

1086
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:58,662
No, no, no! I just found Robbie.
This is his blood. Please!

1087
01:21:58,830 --> 01:22:01,457
Please! There is someone
else out here! Let me in!

1088
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:03,542
If you can't trust him,
don't open the door.

1089
01:22:05,003 --> 01:22:08,005
- Oh, my God, let me in!
- Get away from the door, Charlie.

1090
01:22:08,173 --> 01:22:12,301
- Kirby, it is me. Please let me in!
- Get away from the door, Charlie.

1091
01:22:12,469 --> 01:22:13,677
It's me!

1092
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:17,514
I'm sorry, I can't.

1093
01:22:17,682 --> 01:22:21,018
- What the fuck?!
- I'm sorry.

1094
01:22:21,603 --> 01:22:22,978
- Behind you!
- Look out!

1095
01:22:26,608 --> 01:22:28,317
No! No, no, no, no!

1096
01:22:29,986 --> 01:22:31,028
Kirby!

1097
01:22:41,498 --> 01:22:45,376
Oh, no. God, no, please.
Leave him alone!

1098
01:22:45,543 --> 01:22:47,211
Leave him alone!

1099
01:22:50,548 --> 01:22:52,174
It's Charlie's phone.

1100
01:22:53,551 --> 01:22:56,387
Tell Sidney heads
are gonna roll tonight.

1101
01:22:56,554 --> 01:23:00,766
Tell Sidney it's all because of her.
Or maybe she wants to take his place.

1102
01:23:00,934 --> 01:23:02,559
I promise to be quick.

1103
01:23:02,727 --> 01:23:05,396
- It's him.
- OK, I'm gonna get Jill.

1104
01:23:05,563 --> 01:23:07,564
We should be in the same place.
Just keep him on the phone.

1105
01:23:07,732 --> 01:23:09,066
I'll be right back, OK?

1106
01:23:11,736 --> 01:23:15,572
- Let him go, please.
- I hear you like horror movies, Kirby.

1107
01:23:15,740 --> 01:23:18,033
But do you like them as much as him?

1108
01:23:18,201 --> 01:23:22,246
Forget watching Stab.
You get to live it.

1109
01:23:22,414 --> 01:23:24,748
No, no, no! He's the expert!
It's not me!

1110
01:23:24,916 --> 01:23:28,085
Warm-up question: Jason's weapon?

1111
01:23:28,586 --> 01:23:32,840
- It's a machete.
- There, you see? You do know the genre.

1112
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:34,758
Michael Myers?

1113
01:23:34,926 --> 01:23:36,885
- Butcher knife.
- Leatherface?

1114
01:23:37,053 --> 01:23:38,512
A chainsaw. Please!

1115
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:41,098
Just ask Sidney if you need some help.
Freddy Krueger?

1116
01:23:41,766 --> 01:23:43,100
- Razor hands.
- Name the movie

1117
01:23:43,268 --> 01:23:46,603
that started the slasher craze.
Halloween, Texas Chainsaw Massacre,

1118
01:23:46,771 --> 01:23:49,023
- Last House on the Left or Psycho?
- Psycho!

1119
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:53,235
None of the above! Peeping Tom,
1960, directed by Michael Powell.

1120
01:23:53,403 --> 01:23:56,697
First movie to ever put the audience
in the killer's POV.

1121
01:23:56,865 --> 01:24:00,492
What? Wait. No, no, no.
Please, just ask me one more question!

1122
01:24:00,660 --> 01:24:03,620
- Just one more!
- All right, Kirby.

1123
01:24:03,788 --> 01:24:07,541
Then it's time for your
last chance question.

1124
01:24:07,709 --> 01:24:11,462
Name the remake of the
groundbreaking horror movie in which

1125
01:24:11,629 --> 01:24:14,048
- the villain...
- Halloween, Texas Chainsaw,

1126
01:24:14,215 --> 01:24:16,759
Dawn of the Dead, The Hills Have Eyes,
Amityville Horror,

1127
01:24:16,926 --> 01:24:19,970
Last House on the Left,
Friday the 13th,

1128
01:24:20,138 --> 01:24:22,306
A Nightmare on Elm Street,
My Bloody Valentine,

1129
01:24:22,474 --> 01:24:24,683
When a Stranger Calls, Prom Night,

1130
01:24:24,851 --> 01:24:29,313
Black Christmas, House of Wax,
The Fog, Piranha!

1131
01:24:29,481 --> 01:24:32,733
It's one of those, right? Right?

1132
01:24:40,325 --> 01:24:43,410
I got it right. I was fucking right!

1133
01:24:43,578 --> 01:24:45,037
Jill?

1134
01:24:57,008 --> 01:24:59,343
I won, Charlie! I fucking won!

1135
01:24:59,511 --> 01:25:02,596
I won. He tried to beat me,
but I fucking won.

1136
01:25:02,764 --> 01:25:04,098
Right, Kirby.

1137
01:25:05,141 --> 01:25:07,434
Hold on. OK.

1138
01:25:07,811 --> 01:25:10,604
Almost there. Just hang tight. OK.

1139
01:25:10,772 --> 01:25:13,023
OK. OK. All right.

1140
01:25:13,191 --> 01:25:15,109
Kirby? This is making a move.

1141
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:21,949
Four years of classes together
and you notice me now?

1142
01:25:22,367 --> 01:25:25,077
Stupid bitch! It's too late!

1143
01:25:25,703 --> 01:25:28,038
Shh. Shh.

1144
01:25:28,206 --> 01:25:31,875
I know, I know.
It's OK. Take your time.

1145
01:25:32,043 --> 01:25:34,419
Doesn't happen as fast
as it does in the movies, I know.

1146
01:25:35,797 --> 01:25:37,714
Charlie.

1147
01:26:03,575 --> 01:26:05,325
Kirby?

1148
01:26:09,581 --> 01:26:12,457
You know, you learn a lot when
you watch movies over and over,

1149
01:26:12,625 --> 01:26:15,085
and all the plots
are about trying to kill you.

1150
01:26:16,254 --> 01:26:17,421
Where's Jill?

1151
01:26:17,589 --> 01:26:20,674
You think she's gonna get away?
You think anyone gets away?

1152
01:26:31,102 --> 01:26:32,561
Jill!

1153
01:26:32,729 --> 01:26:35,355
Hello, Sidney. Surprised?

1154
01:26:36,482 --> 01:26:37,816
Watch this.

1155
01:26:37,984 --> 01:26:41,445
This is the part, my dear cousin,
when the cameras...

1156
01:26:42,614 --> 01:26:44,198
...turn off.

1157
01:26:47,785 --> 01:26:50,704
- Charlie?
- Already taken care of.

1158
01:26:50,872 --> 01:26:52,956
Man, I got great footage
of my Robbie kill.

1159
01:26:53,124 --> 01:26:55,626
Better than Jenny and Marnie
or Olivia even.

1160
01:26:55,793 --> 01:26:58,712
Good. We'll cut and upload it later,
and make it all traceable to Trevor.

1161
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,797
Speaking of which...

1162
01:27:04,135 --> 01:27:06,303
- Remind you of anything?
- Jill, please!

1163
01:27:06,471 --> 01:27:08,055
Shut up, dick!

1164
01:27:08,223 --> 01:27:09,640
Evertyhing I learned,
I learned from you.

1165
01:27:09,807 --> 01:27:12,309
You think you had
a shitty boyfriend, Sidney?

1166
01:27:12,477 --> 01:27:18,065
Here's one that fucks you, dumps you
and doesn't even make you famous.

1167
01:27:19,442 --> 01:27:23,570
- What the fuck, Jill?! I loved you!
- Shut the fuck up already!

1168
01:27:26,491 --> 01:27:29,826
I'm sure those cops want you to
have this, Jill. For your protection.

1169
01:27:30,578 --> 01:27:32,955
Mm-mm.

1170
01:27:33,122 --> 01:27:36,124
Baby, please! Baby, please!

1171
01:27:36,292 --> 01:27:38,752
Shouldn't have killed
all those people, Trev.

1172
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:40,921
Gone and put it on video even.

1173
01:27:41,089 --> 01:27:43,006
But it means a lot
that you did it for me.

1174
01:27:43,174 --> 01:27:45,259
What the fuck are you talking about?!

1175
01:27:45,426 --> 01:27:48,971
I am not the girl you cheat on!

1176
01:27:49,639 --> 01:27:51,848
Fuck!

1177
01:27:53,643 --> 01:27:55,978
I've gone through evertyhing.
We're definitely good on timeline.

1178
01:27:56,145 --> 01:28:00,440
- Oh, yeah. We're perfect.
- No, no, no, please!

1179
01:28:07,824 --> 01:28:09,866
Ready for act three?

1180
01:28:10,618 --> 01:28:13,954
Got it figured out yet, Sidney?
In keeping with our remake theme,

1181
01:28:14,122 --> 01:28:16,665
Trevor's this generation's Billy Loomis,

1182
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:20,002
and we're the innocent victims,
Sidney and Randy.

1183
01:28:20,169 --> 01:28:23,755
See, with you, the world
just heard about what happened.

1184
01:28:23,923 --> 01:28:26,717
But with us, they're gonna see it.

1185
01:28:26,884 --> 01:28:30,887
It's gonna be a worldwide sensation.
I mean, people gotta see this shit.

1186
01:28:31,055 --> 01:28:33,307
It's not like anyone reads anymore.

1187
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:40,480
We're gonna know fame
like you never even dreamed of.

1188
01:28:40,648 --> 01:28:43,233
Last two teenagers standing.

1189
01:28:43,401 --> 01:28:45,944
This time Randy gets the girl.

1190
01:28:51,242 --> 01:28:53,869
You were amazing.
You're the perfect victim.

1191
01:28:54,037 --> 01:28:57,789
I was so believable today, wasn't I?

1192
01:28:57,957 --> 01:29:02,252
I mean, I told so many lies
that I actually started to believe them.

1193
01:29:02,628 --> 01:29:04,421
I really think that I was born for this.

1194
01:29:04,589 --> 01:29:06,381
How could you do this?

1195
01:29:08,509 --> 01:29:11,678
Do you know what it was like
growing up in this family?

1196
01:29:11,846 --> 01:29:17,434
Related to you? I mean, all I ever heard
was Sidney this and Sidney that

1197
01:29:17,602 --> 01:29:23,398
and Sidney, Sidney, Sidney.
You were always just so fucking special!

1198
01:29:24,150 --> 01:29:27,778
- Well, now I'm the special one.
- You'll slip. They always do.

1199
01:29:29,238 --> 01:29:31,239
Come on, Charlie,
let's get on with this.

1200
01:29:33,368 --> 01:29:35,619
You have to be strong.

1201
01:29:35,787 --> 01:29:37,621
And hold still. OK?

1202
01:29:37,789 --> 01:29:41,083
Yeah. Yeah, old-school,
like Billy and Stu.

1203
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:43,293
Come on, baby, get it up!

1204
01:29:43,461 --> 01:29:48,298
Come on! Shoulder me! Shoulder me!
Shoulder me! Get it up!

1205
01:29:51,969 --> 01:29:56,056
The heart! That's not
the way we rehearsed it.

1206
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:59,601
You said it, Charlie.
Billy and Stu, Trevor and you.

1207
01:30:00,645 --> 01:30:05,565
What the media really loves, baby,
is a sole survivor.

1208
01:30:05,733 --> 01:30:07,401
Just ask you-know-who.

1209
01:30:07,568 --> 01:30:09,778
Trevor was your partner.

1210
01:30:09,946 --> 01:30:12,322
But you, you were the idea man.

1211
01:30:22,458 --> 01:30:24,042
Even your friends.

1212
01:30:25,253 --> 01:30:28,755
My friends?
What world are you living in?

1213
01:30:28,923 --> 01:30:30,590
I don't need friends.

1214
01:30:30,758 --> 01:30:34,469
I need fans. Don't you get it?

1215
01:30:34,637 --> 01:30:38,181
This has never been about killing you.

1216
01:30:38,349 --> 01:30:41,309
It's about becoming you.

1217
01:30:41,477 --> 01:30:44,020
I mean, for fuck's sake,
my own mother had to die,

1218
01:30:44,188 --> 01:30:48,150
no great loss there,
so I could stay true to the original.

1219
01:30:48,317 --> 01:30:50,068
That's sick, right?

1220
01:30:50,236 --> 01:30:53,447
Well, sick is the new sane.

1221
01:30:53,614 --> 01:30:57,033
You had your 15 minutes,
now I want mine!

1222
01:30:57,201 --> 01:31:00,537
I mean, what am I supposed to do?
Go to college?

1223
01:31:00,705 --> 01:31:03,206
Grad school? Work?

1224
01:31:03,374 --> 01:31:07,043
Look around. We all live in public now,
we're all on the Internet.

1225
01:31:07,211 --> 01:31:10,380
How do you think people
become famous anymore?

1226
01:31:10,548 --> 01:31:14,259
You don't have to achieve anything.

1227
01:31:14,427 --> 01:31:17,554
You just gotta have fucked-up shit
happen to you.

1228
01:31:17,722 --> 01:31:20,640
So you do have to die, Sid.

1229
01:31:20,808 --> 01:31:24,728
Those are the rules.
New movie, new franchise.

1230
01:31:24,896 --> 01:31:28,815
There's only room for one lead,
and let's face it, your ingénue days,

1231
01:31:28,983 --> 01:31:30,775
they're over.

1232
01:31:37,033 --> 01:31:39,034
Don't tell me you didn't
know this day would come.

1233
01:33:00,366 --> 01:33:01,992
Fuck!

1234
01:34:22,073 --> 01:34:23,907
Come on, let's move it!

1235
01:34:33,751 --> 01:34:35,585
Check the rooms,
both sides and upstairs.

1236
01:34:35,753 --> 01:34:36,920
Yes, ma'am.

1237
01:34:54,105 --> 01:34:56,272
Jill, can you give us a description
of the murderer?

1238
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:58,149
What happened in there?

1239
01:34:59,985 --> 01:35:02,529
Did you see the killer's face?
What did he look like?

1240
01:35:10,287 --> 01:35:12,997
Jill, how does it feel to be a hero?

1241
01:35:24,301 --> 01:35:28,638
Jill. You made it.
That's all that matters.

1242
01:35:28,806 --> 01:35:33,727
Trevor, Charlie, they tried to kill me.
And I heard they killed my mom.

1243
01:35:33,894 --> 01:35:35,645
And... and Robbie and Kirby, too.

1244
01:35:35,813 --> 01:35:37,105
Shh.

1245
01:35:37,273 --> 01:35:40,024
Just lay back. Try to rest.

1246
01:35:41,652 --> 01:35:43,153
Is your wife...?

1247
01:35:44,822 --> 01:35:47,991
She's gonna be fine. She's recovering.

1248
01:35:49,285 --> 01:35:52,996
If I ever write a book one day, I'd...
I'd want her to write it with me.

1249
01:35:53,164 --> 01:35:57,834
We'd be a good team with
our matching wounds and all.

1250
01:36:00,671 --> 01:36:02,672
We're survivors now.

1251
01:36:03,841 --> 01:36:06,009
I just wish Sidney was, too.

1252
01:36:06,177 --> 01:36:10,472
Jill, they're not sure yet.

1253
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:14,684
It's still touch and go,
but she's in ICU.

1254
01:36:14,852 --> 01:36:18,354
And they think Sidney
just might make it.

1255
01:36:19,315 --> 01:36:23,151
What? But I saw Trevor kill her.

1256
01:36:23,319 --> 01:36:28,114
Look, we don't know yet,
but she's hanging on.

1257
01:36:31,202 --> 01:36:33,203
I wanna see her.

1258
01:36:33,788 --> 01:36:38,541
She's not awake yet.
And she may not remember anything.

1259
01:36:38,709 --> 01:36:41,044
You'll have to help her with that.

1260
01:36:41,212 --> 01:36:44,631
All in time.
Just get some rest now, OK?

1261
01:37:33,764 --> 01:37:37,058
- She gonna be OK?
- Yeah.

1262
01:37:37,226 --> 01:37:40,645
- She's a strong kid.
- She's gonna have to be.

1263
01:37:43,107 --> 01:37:44,983
She asked if you were OK.

1264
01:37:45,150 --> 01:37:47,735
She thinks you guys
should write a book together,

1265
01:37:47,903 --> 01:37:49,529
with your matching wounds.

1266
01:37:49,697 --> 01:37:51,573
Why, she was stabbed in the shoulder?

1267
01:37:55,786 --> 01:37:57,620
How did she know I was, too?

1268
01:38:03,127 --> 01:38:04,377
Shit!

1269
01:38:10,342 --> 01:38:12,510
You just won't die, will you?

1270
01:38:14,096 --> 01:38:17,098
Who are you? Michael fucking Myers?

1271
01:38:18,601 --> 01:38:20,351
Yeah, I don't think so.

1272
01:38:25,024 --> 01:38:27,191
Fucking die already!

1273
01:38:50,633 --> 01:38:52,133
How are those stitches?

1274
01:38:57,222 --> 01:38:58,222
Sidney!

1275
01:39:02,144 --> 01:39:05,229
Hicks, get up to Sidney Prescott's room
and call for backup!

1276
01:39:05,397 --> 01:39:06,856
Be right up, sir!

1277
01:39:14,907 --> 01:39:16,240
Sid!

1278
01:39:17,034 --> 01:39:18,534
- Sid.
- Dewey!

1279
01:39:37,221 --> 01:39:39,055
Is this how it's gonna be, Sid?

1280
01:39:39,223 --> 01:39:41,182
The ending of the movie
was supposed to be at the house.

1281
01:39:41,350 --> 01:39:46,312
- I mean, this is just silly.
- Consider this an alternate ending.

1282
01:39:47,773 --> 01:39:49,190
You're never gonna
get out of this, Jill.

1283
01:39:49,358 --> 01:39:51,067
- Of course I will.
- Dewey!

1284
01:39:53,028 --> 01:39:54,153
Sid...

1285
01:39:54,697 --> 01:39:58,992
Easy. OK, wait.
What about the book?

1286
01:39:59,159 --> 01:40:01,369
Looks like I'll just
have to write it myself.

1287
01:40:03,747 --> 01:40:05,123
Damn it! Oh!

1288
01:40:06,834 --> 01:40:10,128
Don't even think about shooting,
or I'll blow Dewey's head off.

1289
01:40:10,671 --> 01:40:14,132
You think I won't do it?
Give me your gun!

1290
01:40:14,299 --> 01:40:15,299
Do it!

1291
01:40:25,102 --> 01:40:27,103
You just had to be the hero, huh?

1292
01:40:28,272 --> 01:40:29,814
Give me your gun.

1293
01:40:31,608 --> 01:40:34,110
What are you, deaf?

1294
01:40:34,278 --> 01:40:36,988
Give me your gun!

1295
01:40:43,912 --> 01:40:45,621
Now, get up.

1296
01:40:47,791 --> 01:40:49,417
And keep your hands over your head.

1297
01:40:49,585 --> 01:40:51,669
Don't do anything stupid...

1298
01:40:53,130 --> 01:40:55,256
Don't fucking tell me what to do.

1299
01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:58,968
- Oh, God.
- Now, get up, bitch.

1300
01:40:59,136 --> 01:41:02,722
- OK.
- Get up.

1301
01:41:03,307 --> 01:41:05,349
- Now!
- OK.

1302
01:41:09,146 --> 01:41:10,313
Come on.

1303
01:41:16,445 --> 01:41:19,614
Let's go.
Get your skinny ass out here.

1304
01:41:20,824 --> 01:41:22,158
OK.

1305
01:41:23,577 --> 01:41:26,829
I'm gonna enjoy blowing your head off.

1306
01:41:26,997 --> 01:41:30,249
OK, but can I just...

1307
01:41:31,627 --> 01:41:33,169
...have one final word?

1308
01:41:33,337 --> 01:41:35,630
What? "Please"?

1309
01:41:37,591 --> 01:41:38,758
No.

1310
01:41:41,720 --> 01:41:44,097
- Clear.
- Clear?

1311
01:41:44,264 --> 01:41:45,348
Clear.

1312
01:41:50,521 --> 01:41:52,814
You forgot the first rule
of remakes, Jill.

1313
01:41:52,981 --> 01:41:55,024
Don't fuck with the original.

1314
01:41:59,404 --> 01:42:01,114
Oh, my God, Dewey.

1315
01:42:01,281 --> 01:42:04,826
- What hit me?
- Don't ask.

1316
01:42:07,329 --> 01:42:08,329
You OK?

1317
01:42:11,458 --> 01:42:14,293
She was standing right behind me.

1318
01:42:15,754 --> 01:42:17,672
They always are.

1319
01:42:29,726 --> 01:42:30,935
Oh, God.

1320
01:42:32,437 --> 01:42:33,813
Nice one.

1321
01:42:35,357 --> 01:42:37,024
Hicks? You're alive?

1322
01:42:39,069 --> 01:42:42,155
Wear the vest, save your chest.

1323
01:42:44,366 --> 01:42:48,411
We got two officers down.
Several injuries.

1324
01:42:48,579 --> 01:42:50,121
And a new suspect.

1325
01:42:51,748 --> 01:42:54,959
We need a doctor, goddamn it!

1326
01:42:55,502 --> 01:42:58,254
I don't know about you,
but I feel a whole lot better.

1327
01:43:01,842 --> 01:43:03,968
We're live at
Woodsboro Community Hospital

1328
01:43:04,136 --> 01:43:07,763
awaiting a first public statement
from Jill Roberts, survivor.

1329
01:43:07,931 --> 01:43:12,435
...a survivor of what is now being
called the Woodsboro Massacre Reboot.

1330
01:43:12,603 --> 01:43:15,980
Jill Roberts is her name,
a name the whole world will now know.

1331
01:43:16,148 --> 01:43:18,024
...who single-handedly put a stop

1332
01:43:18,192 --> 01:43:21,402
to this 21 st century
Woodsboro killing spree.

1333
01:43:21,570 --> 01:43:26,282
Jill Roberts of Woodsboro, a girl
who's lifted all our spirits tonight.

1334
01:43:26,450 --> 01:43:30,286
An American hero,
right out of the movies.
